      ## Requirements
      - Must use AWS Amplify libraries for Cognito integration
      - Must follow the existing design system for UI components
      - Must implement proper error handling and validation
      - Must be responsive on all device sizes
      
      ## Deliverables
      - Authentication components (SignUp, SignIn, ForgotPassword, etc.)
      - Integration with AWS Cognito
      - Unit tests for all components
      - Documentation of the implementation
      
      ## Success Criteria
      - All authentication flows work as expected
      - UI matches the design mockups
      - Tests pass with >90% coverage
      - Code follows project standards and patterns
      
      ## Next Steps

      - Consider both frontend and backend performance
      - Document findings with evidence
      - Prioritize potential solutions based on impact and effort
      
      ## Deliverables
      - Performance analysis report
      - Identified bottlenecks with supporting evidence
      - Recommended solutions with priority order
      - Any quick fixes that can be implemented immediately
      
      ## Success Criteria
      - Clear identification of the root cause(s)
      - Evidence-based analysis with metrics
      - Actionable recommendations for improvement
      - Implementation plan for the recommended solutions

      # Task: Refactor Form Components to Use Cloudscape
      
      ## Rules
      Follow all the rules for Frontend Code mode, found in markdown files in the folder .roo/rules-frontend-code.
      
      ## Context
      Our application currently uses custom form components that don't follow a consistent design system. We've decided to standardize on AWS Cloudscape Design System for all UI components. The backend API endpoints and validation logic remain unchanged.
      
      ## Objective
      Refactor the existing form components to use Cloudscape components, maintaining the same functionality but improving the UI consistency, accessibility, and maintainability.
      
      ## Requirements
      - Replace custom form components with Cloudscape equivalents
      - Maintain existing form validation logic
      - Ensure backward compatibility with existing form data structures
      - Improve accessibility and responsive behavior
      - Add comprehensive tests for the refactored components
      
      ## Deliverables
      - Refactored form components using Cloudscape
      - Updated form validation integration
      - Unit and integration tests
      - Documentation of the refactored components
      
      ## Success Criteria
      - Forms maintain the same functionality as before
      - UI is consistent with other Cloudscape components
      - Forms are accessible according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards
      - Tests pass with >90% coverage
      - No regression in form validation or submission
      
      ## Next Steps
      After refactoring, Debug mode will verify the form functionality and test edge cases.

      ## Context
      We need to add data visualization capabilities to our application to help users understand their metrics better. The backend API endpoints for retrieving the necessary data are already implemented. We've decided to use AWS Cloudscape Design System for the UI components and a charting library compatible with React.
      
      ## Objective
      Implement a set of reusable data visualization components that integrate with our existing application and follow best practices for React, TypeScript, and Cloudscape.
      
      ## Requirements
      - Create reusable chart components (line, bar, pie, etc.)
      - Integrate with Cloudscape Design System
      - Implement proper loading states, error handling, and empty states
      - Ensure components are responsive and accessible
      - Add comprehensive tests for all components
      - Optimize performance for large datasets
      
      ## Deliverables
      - Reusable chart components
      - Integration examples with existing pages
      - Unit and integration tests
      - Documentation of component usage and props
      - Performance optimization recommendations
      
      ## Success Criteria
      - Charts render correctly with various data inputs
      - Components integrate seamlessly with Cloudscape
      - UI is responsive and accessible
      - Tests pass with >90% coverage
      - Performance is acceptable with large datasets

      # Task: Migrate Customer Data from MySQL to DynamoDB

      ## Rules
      Follow all the rules for DB Migration mode, found in markdown files in the folder .roo/rules-db-migration.

      ## Context
      Our application currently uses a MySQL database for customer data storage. As part of our move to a more scalable architecture, we've decided to migrate this data to AWS DynamoDB. The customer data includes personal information, purchase history, and preferences. The migration needs to be performed with minimal downtime.

      ## Objective
      Plan and execute the migration of customer data from MySQL to DynamoDB using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) with Change Data Capture (CDC) to minimize downtime.

      ## Requirements
      - Set up AWS DMS replication instance with appropriate configuration
      - Configure MySQL source with binary logging for CDC
      - Design appropriate DynamoDB table structure with efficient partition and sort keys
      - Create and configure DMS tasks for full load and ongoing replication
      - Monitor the migration process and validate data integrity
      - Document the migration process and any issues encountered

      ## Deliverables
      - DynamoDB table design documentation
      - AWS DMS configuration details
      - Migration execution plan with timeline
      - Validation strategy and results
      - Post-migration cleanup plan
      - Rollback strategy in case of issues

      ## Success Criteria
      - All customer data successfully migrated to DynamoDB
      - Data integrity verified through validation checks
      - Minimal application downtime during cutover
      - Performance metrics for the new DynamoDB implementation
      - Documentation of the migration process for future reference

      ## Next Steps
      After successful migration, Code mode will update the application to use the new DynamoDB data source instead of MySQL.

      # Task: Create Integration Tests for New MCP Tool

      ## Rules
      Follow all the rules for FastMCP Test Engineer mode, found in markdown files in the folder .roo/rules-fastmcp-test-engineer and context files in .roo/context/fastmcp-ts-testing.roo.yaml.

      ## Context
      Code mode has just implemented a new tool `calculate_metrics` for the `data-analysis-server` MCP server (TypeScript implementation). The tool takes numerical data and returns statistical metrics. The server code is located in `mcp-servers/data-analysis-server/`.

      ## Objective
      Develop a comprehensive suite of integration tests for the new `calculate_metrics` tool using FastMCP's testing utilities.

      ## Requirements
      - Test various valid input scenarios (different data types, sizes).
      - Test edge cases (empty input, invalid data types).
      - Test error handling for expected failures.
      - Utilize FastMCP's in-process testing features.
      - Ensure tests cover tool input validation and output correctness.
      - Integrate tests into the existing test suite (`npm test`).

      ## Deliverables
      - Integration test file(s) for the `calculate_metrics` tool.
      - Updated `package.json` if necessary to run new tests.
      - Documentation within the test files explaining the scenarios.

      ## Success Criteria
      - Tests cover all specified requirements.
      - Tests pass reliably in the CI environment.
      - Test coverage for the new tool meets project standards (>85%).
      - Tests are well-structured and maintainable.

      ## Next Steps
      Once tests are implemented and passing, the MCP server can be considered ready for integration with other components or deployment. Debug mode may perform further end-to-end validation.

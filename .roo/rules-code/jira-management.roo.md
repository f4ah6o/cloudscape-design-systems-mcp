# Jira Ticket Management

This document outlines the practices and procedures for managing Jira tickets throughout the development lifecycle.

## Jira Ticket Creation Workflow

- **Create Tickets Before Development**: Always create or ensure a Jira ticket exists BEFORE starting any development work
- **Required Fields by Issue Type**:
  - **Story**: Must include:
    - Acceptance criteria that clearly define when the story is complete
    - Reference to parent Epic (if applicable)
    - User-focused description in the format "As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"
  - **Bug**: Must include steps to reproduce and expected behavior
  - **Task**: Must include clear definition of done
  - **Epic**: Must include:
    - A clear business objective or goal the epic addresses
    - High-level scope definition with boundaries
    - Success metrics or KPIs to measure completion
    - Dependencies on other epics or systems (if any)
    - Estimated timeline (sprints/iterations)
- **Creating Tickets Programmatically**:
  ```python
  # Example: Create a Story with acceptance criteria
  call_tool("jira-server", "create_issue", {
      "projectKey": "PMS",
      "summary": "Implement feature X",
      "issueType": "Story",
      "description": "As a user, I want to...\n\n*Acceptance Criteria:*\n1. Feature works when...\n2. Tests are added for...\n3. Documentation is updated with...",
      "priority": "Medium"
  })
  ```

## Ticket Status Management

- Set ticket to "In Progress" when starting work using `update_issue` tool
- Include ticket ID in branch names and commits
- Reference tickets in PR descriptions
- Run all tests before marking any work as complete
- Update ticket status to "Done" ONLY after all acceptance criteria are met and tests pass
- Use `update_issue` tool to update status throughout the development lifecycle

## Ticket Completion Requirements

Before marking any ticket as "Done":

1. **Verify All Acceptance Criteria**: Each item in the acceptance criteria must be explicitly verified
2. **Run All Tests**: All test suites relevant to the changes must pass:
   ```bash
   # Run relevant test suites
   python -m pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/
   ```
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure documentation reflects any changes made
4. **Update Jira Status**: Only after all above requirements are met
   ```python
   # Update ticket status to Done
   call_tool("jira-server", "update_issue", {
       "issueKey": "PMS-123",
       "status": "Done"
   })
   ```

## Issue Linking

- Link related issues appropriately
- Use proper link types (e.g., "blocks", "is blocked by")
- Include linked issues in PR descriptions

## Issue Hierarchy and Relationships

- **Epic-Story Relationship**:
  - Stories should be linked to their parent Epic using the "Epic Link" field
  - When creating a Story, always verify if it belongs to an Epic
  - Stories without an Epic should be exceptions, not the norm
  - When describing a Story's context, reference its parent Epic
  - Story acceptance criteria should align with Epic success metrics

- **Creating Child Stories from Epics**:
  ```python
  # Example: Create a Story linked to Epic PMS-8
  call_tool("jira-server", "create_issue", {
      "projectKey": "PMS",
      "summary": "Implement configuration validation",
      "issueType": "Story",
      "description": "As a developer, I want to validate my configuration file so that I can catch errors before runtime.\n\n*Part of Epic: PMS-8 (Configuration System)*\n\n*Acceptance Criteria:*\n1. Validates against JSON schema\n2. Provides clear error messages\n3. Tests cover validation edge cases",
      "priority": "Medium",
      "customFields": {
          "epic-link": "PMS-8"  # Link to parent Epic
      }
  })

        description: "Insights gained from the failed attempt"
    example: |
      "Failed Attempts:
      1. Attempted to fix by wrapping in try/catch:
         - Implementation: Added try/catch block around the API call
         - Failure: Error was suppressed but component still didn't render correctly
         - Analysis: The try/catch only handled the symptom, not the root cause
         - Lesson: Error handling should address root causes, not just suppress errors
      
      2. Attempted to use optional chaining:
         - Implementation: Changed to response?.data?.items?.map()
         - Failure: Still failed when response was undefined
         - Analysis: Optional chaining helps with nested properties but not with undefined base objects
         - Lesson: Need to verify the base object exists before attempting to access properties"
